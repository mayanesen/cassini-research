# cassini-research

Project Overview:
Cassini-Huygens is space-research mission by NASA, launched in 1997 and deactivated in 2007 to study Saturn and its system, meaning its rings and natural satellites. It is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit. The data utilized in this project was retrieved from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). The ISS data is archived with the Planetary Data System (PDS) and its archive contains 400,000 images split between 125 volumes, along with an additional 11 volumes worth of calibration files, software, and ground calibration images. The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based data analysis tool to make the data regarding Saturn's rings easily accessible and processible through images and metadata, which can later be used for other visual and analysis purposes. The tool will enable the retrieval of geometric parameters and visual parameter profiles associated with images of the rings. The database produced will contain metadata, geometric constraints, and visual parameters. This would allow researchers to get important data for ring analysis from raw ISS files, without requiring the complex processing steps as listed in the ISSâ€™s data user guide.
